    "art = '<p>Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SGMO#NASDAQ\">SGMO</a>), a genomic medicine company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track Designation to isaralgagene civaparvovec, or ST-920, a wholly owned gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of Fabry disease.</p><p>Fast Track designation aims to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new therapeutics that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. Companies granted this designation are given the opportunity for more frequent interactions with the FDA. These clinical programs may also be eligible to apply for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review if relevant criteria are met. The FDA has previously granted ST-920 Orphan Drug Designation.</p><p>\"We are thrilled with the FDA\\'s decision to grant Fast Track Designation for ST-920. Fabry is a debilitating disease with life-long impact,\" said Nathalie Dubois-Stringfellow, Ph.D, Sangamo\\'s Senior Vice President, Chief Development Officer. \"This decision from the FDA underscores the potential for ST-920 to address a serious unmet need and serve as a meaningful therapeutic option for patients with Fabry disease. We are highly encouraged by this promising development and look forward to our expected meeting with the FDA on Phase 3 trial design in the summer.\"</p><p>ST-920 is currently being evaluated in the Phase 1/2 STAAR study, with a total of 20 patients dosed to date. In February 2023, Sangamo announced promising results from the STAAR study via an oral presentation at the 19th Annual WORLD<i>Symposium, </i>showing sustained, elevated expression of alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity in the 13 dosed patients as of the data cutoff, 78% globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) substrate clearance at 6-months and 77% reduction in urine podocyte loss in one of the first kidney biopsies, and a clinically meaningful and statistically significant increase in mean general health scores, as measured by the SF-36 General Health survey. A copy of the presentation is available in the <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.sangamo.com%2Fpresentations&amp;esheet=53403648&amp;newsitemid=20230522005108&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Presentations+section+of+the+Sangamo+website&amp;index=1&amp;md5=b8ed12a9ebf94820f3dec0b898757f74\">Presentations section of the Sangamo website</a>. Sangamo is currently preparing for a potential Phase 3 trial and plans to meet with the FDA on the proposed Phase 3 study design in the summer, with a trial start anticipated by the end of 2023, depending on regulatory interactions.</p><p><strong>About the STAAR Study</strong></p><p>The Phase 1/2 STAAR study is a global open-label, single-dose, dose-ranging, multicenter clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of isaralgagene civaparvovec, or ST-920, a gene therapy product candidate in patients with Fabry disease. Isaralgagene civaparvovec requires a one-time infusion without preconditioning. The STAAR study is enrolling patients who are on ERT, are ERT pseudo-naïve (defined as having been off ERT for six or more months), or who are ERT-naïve. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track designation to isaralgagene civaparvovec, which has also received Orphan Medicinal Product designation from the European Medicines Agency.</p>'"

Strengthened market infrastructure and a shifting regulatory environment have encouraged traditional financial institutions to explore the potential of digital assets.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In an exclusive interview with <strong>Benzinga</strong>, EMURGO's COO <strong>Nikhil Joshi</strong> talks about the company's blockchain innovation and transformation strategy, how it is handling rapidly changing regulatory environment, challenges faced by the global crypto market and much more.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>EMURGO, a global blockchain technology company, is one of the founding entities of the Cardano blockchain. It delivers products and services aimed at advancing the adoption of Cardano's Web3 ecosystem through initiatives in education, investment, and infrastructure development.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How is EMURGO innovating in Web3, and what impact will it have on traditional finance and global financial systems?</strong><strong></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a founding entity of the Cardano network, EMURGO is pioneering Web3 innovations through its suite of products and partnerships aimed at accelerating the commercial adoption of blockchain. Since our inception in 2019, we have developed and advanced solutions in fintech and cemented strategic collaborations to bridge the gap between decentralised technologies and mainstream financial systems. Today, as the tokenisation of real-world assets gains traction and is slated to redefine the traditional financial ecosystem, EMURGO has emerged as a catalyst for Web3 solutions, steering education and adoption for the burgeoning sector.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As advocates for Web3, EMURGO has also been working closely with the public sector to drive positive development for the blockchain industry. Through concerted efforts, we have been embedding trust and transparency with policymakers, forging opportunities that reduce counterparty risks, streamline regulatory compliance, and pave the way for a more inclusive financial ecosystem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Can you explain how EMURGO&#8217;s collaboration with Huawei Cloud is helping to scale Web3 solutions across the Asia Pacific region and beyond?</strong><strong></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Our partnership with Huawei Cloud is a significant milestone for EMURGO and the Cardano ecosystem. As one of the world's largest cloud computing companies, Huawei Cloud&#8217;s entry into the Cardano ecosystem will bring Huawei's cloud infrastructure into Cardano's open-source public blockchain ecosystem, driving growth and Web3 adoption in APAC and Africa. At the same time, the joint partnership will lower the entry barriers for non-native players to utilise Cardano nodes and set up tech infrastructure to easily build solutions on the Cardano network.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What are EMURGO's key strategies for navigating the rapidly changing regulatory environment in Asia, and how will this affect the future of Web3 adoption?</strong><strong></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The future of Web3 adoption in Asia hinges on the balance between innovation and regulation. Already, Asia Pacific nations are taking the lead in crypto adoption worldwide, and we've seen how jurisdictions from Singapore to Hong Kong are implementing regulatory clarity to better shape the emerging digital asset sector.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a member of the Web3 Subcommittee of the Singapore Fintech Association, for example, EMURGO actively supports the mission to create and sustain a responsible and innovative Web3 ecosystem in Singapore and the region. This includes fostering a framework focused on innovation, consumer protection, financial education, and market integrity, which are crucial to guiding sustainable Web3 growth. Seeing the value of both sides of the coin, EMURGO's strategies have been shaped to foster dialogue and compliance within the Web3 sector, encouraging an optimal environment for innovation to thrive.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How does EMURGO integrate Web3 technology within existing Web2 frameworks, and what challenges have been encountered during this transition?</strong><strong></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To us at EMURGO, the shift from Web2 to Web3 is not about abandoning the old for the new. Because our company's background is blended, with a few of us coming from more traditional backgrounds, we see value in melding the two worlds to complement both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems. Since our founding, we have been actively pushing for interoperability — creating tools that allow Web2 platforms to communicate better with blockchain networks. This helps traditional companies dip their toes into Web3 by incorporating features like tokenisation or decentralised identity without needing to start from scratch.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Traditional Web2 systems are built to handle millions of transactions quickly, while many newer blockchain networks face a combination of challenges due to its decentralised nature — its consensus mechanisms and the trade-offs it requires to maintain security across its decentralised network. EMURGO's role is essential here, as we invest in and support solutions that drive opportunities to integrate blockchain more efficiently, paving the way for seamless interoperability between Web2 and Web3.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What upcoming initiatives does EMURGO have planned to ensure a strong, sustainable future for the Web3 ecosystem?</strong><strong></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Earlier in September EMURGO partnered with Ibex, the corporate innovation arm of Antler, one of the world's most active early-stage investors. The collaboration will leverage EMURGO's deep expertise and Antler's expansive global network to drive innovation at the intersection of fintech and Web3 technologies. This is the first announced partnership in a pipeline of upcoming collaborations that EMURGO will announce in due time that will focus on identifying, investing, and driving the growth of global founders and startup projects across the world.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>What are the biggest challenges facing the global crypto market today, and how are these affecting the growth and adoption of blockchain technology? </strong><strong></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Despite crypto's growing mainstream and institutional acceptance, many still view the sector with apprehension and caution. Its reputation as a vehicle for illicit activities continues to undermine its critical use case in the future of finance. While, of course, blockchain does not equate to crypto, the technology&#8217;s interconnectivity with digital currency has become so synonymous that blockchain has faced the unintended consequences of crypto's volatility.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What we need today is more concerted efforts to educate and inform, ensuring that ignorance doesn't become a barrier to the adoption of innovative technologies and new currencies. In doing so, we can strengthen the financial ecosystem at large, ensuring the longevity of the blockchain and crypto sectors.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How are regulatory pressures and market volatility shaping the current and future landscape of the crypto industry worldwide? </strong><strong></strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As the digital assets sector is still in its nascent stage, regulators are often playing catch up to understand how best to set guardrails to protect consumers and companies alike. In doing so, they tend to apply existing policies and approaches to the entirely new ecosystem which often run counter to the nature of Web3, resulting in ill-fitting solutions to emerging challenges. &nbsp;While regulations to shield users without impeding DeFi innovation still need to be developed, we're seeing encouraging signs of policies and initiatives that are accelerating the acceptance and adoption of crypto. Singapore, for example, is one such lighthouse jurisdiction that continues to play a leading role in the safe adoption of digital assets through regulatory clarity and oversight for digital asset exchanges and service providers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cross-industry collaboration is critical to developing a deeper understanding of blockchain technology and advancing the ecosystem's maturity. At EMURGO, we are committed to continuing our work with policymakers and industry stakeholders around the globe, helping unlock blockchain's full potential. Together, we aim to drive innovation, enhance security, and create more efficient, transparent systems for everyone.</p>\", text='everyone.', text_embedding=[-0.027745374, 0.018091427, -0.0028414524,

What Happened: Palihapitiya, who once possessed a substantial amount of Bitcoin in his funds, expressed his remorse over the sale on the All In Podcast on Monday. I actually think about all the Bitcoin I soldthats a, I dont know, a three or four billion dollar mistake in growing now, he stated.

Obviously I shouldnt have sold it. Would have made them a lot more money, Palihapitiya admitted. Why It Matters: Bitcoin has made history by surpassing the $90,000 mark, propelled by Trumps pro-cryptocurrency stance and the prospect of a crypto-friendly Congress. The value of Bitcoin has risen by 90% in 2024, spurred by robust demand for dedicated U.S. exchange-traded funds and interest-rate reductions by the Federal Reserve. Bitcoins surge, which reached new heights following the US election, has yielded returns that outstrip those from other investments such as stocks and gold.

Vance and Trump ally Elon Musk in separate interviews on his popular podcast during the campaign season, which may have helped Trump win the presidential election. But a proposed podcast between Rogan and presidential candidate Kamala Harris never came to fruition and there are new details on why it didnt happen. What Happened: Rogan endorsed Trump for president and his conversations with Trump and Vance were viewed as long free-flowing conversations that may have helped voters have new views on the campaign team that ultimately won the 2024 election race. A key driver of subscribers for Spotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT), \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast is one of the most listened to podcasts around the world and its popularity can help provide name awareness for people like political candidates. In a recent episode of the podcast, Rogan said that one of the reasons the Harris team did not agree to the vice president appearing on the podcast was wanting to have stipulations on topics that were off-limits. \"I think they had requirements on things that she didn't want to talk about. She didn't want to talk about marijuana legalization, which I thought was hilarious,\" Rogan said on the recent episode. Rogan alleged that Harris' team didn't want to upset progressive voters, as reported by the New York Post. The popular podcaster said Harris' team reached out to Rogan's team about a potential interview after news reports of Trump agreeing to a sit down with Rogan surfaced. Scheduling did not work out between Rogan's team and Harris' team, with the podcaster saying he wanted to shoot the episode at the studio in Texas. Another demand from the Harris team was to limit the sit-down interview to around one hour, instead of the typical three hours for Rogan interviews.\u001b[0m\n",

Taiki Maeda echoed this shift, expressing reduced excitement for Ethereum, adding, \"If people want to make money, theyre going to go to meme coins.\" Miles Deutscher shared his success story with Pepe, which he bought at a $100 million market cap before its climb to $10 billion, advocating for \"concentrated diversification\" in investment strategies. The group discussed meme coins' rapid repricing, with Miles noting, \"Clusters of memes under $200 million have quickly jumped to the $400-$600 million range.\" They also highlighted Bitcoins (CRYPTO: BTC) strength and institutional interest, with Taiki predicting, \"Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) is going to flip Solana (CRYPTO: SOL).\" Also Read: EXCLUSIVE: Binance CEO Richard Teng Says 2025 Will Outshine 2024 For Crypto While meme coins are gaining momentum, influencers expressed caution.

What Happened: In a recent post on X, Benioff expressed his admiration for the AI tool, praising its zero latency and labeling it the future of consumer AI. He also commended Google CEO Sundar Pichai for the innovation. Benioffs positive review of Gemini Live comes in the wake of his public criticism of Microsoft Corps (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI assistant, Copilot, which he has previously described as disappointing. Google launched the smartphone app for Gemini Live on Apple Inc.s (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store just a few months after making the virtual assistant free for users. The app allows users to interact with an AI chatbot through natural conversation.

Well, Intel is teetering perilously close to irrelevance, and Nvidia wasnt on anyones radar screen five years ago. So disruptors get disrupted. Why It Matters: Arnotts warning echoes concerns raised by other market experts. In October, Billionaire Jeremy Grantham warned that the current economy is the most vulnerable market ever. This was after the U.S. stock markets surge, fueled by the promise of artificial intelligence, drew comparisons to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. These concerns are particularly relevant given the recent performance of MicroStrategy Inc., whose shares hit a 24-year high, marking the highest level since the dot-com bubble in March 2000. This surge was fueled by the rise in Bitcoin (CRYPTO: Bitcoin), a crucial asset held by the company in its portfolio. Price Action: The S&P 500 Index closed at 5,870.62 points on Friday, it has yielded 23.78% on a year-to-date basis and 30.22% over the last year.

The Core of Analyst Ratings: What Every Investor Should Know Benzinga tracks 150 analyst firms and reports on their stock expectations. Analysts typically arrive at their conclusions by predicting how much money a company will make in the future, usually the upcoming five years, and how risky or predictable that company's revenue streams are. Analysts attend company conference calls and meetings, research company financial statements, and communicate with insiders to publish their ratings on stocks. Analysts typically rate each stock once per quarter or whenever the company has a major update. Some analysts also offer predictions for helpful metrics such as earnings, revenue, and growth estimates to provide further guidance as to what to do with certain tickers. It is important to keep in mind that while stock and sector analysts are specialists, they are also human and can only forecast their beliefs to traders.

I think the only way is basically just to be ready for a change. So, its true. Everything that worked in April doesnt work right now. Everything that worked on the summer doesnt work right now. Your advertisement model doesnt work anymore because everyone can dump their price. Their community is more kind of, how to say that, like not that loyal, not that cool, not that wealthy. And they always will have lower price. You cannot fight and compete with them, right? So, we must learn and see, okay, what model we can use right now. Right now, we think our advantage is to build things with soul inside. Lets say we help projects to build games that are really touching, nice games, that its not just make people addictive or something. Its more about real emotional experience that you have for some time. Again, Pixel Battle is a great example. Another one, Lost Dogs. I dont see a big difference between TV show, game, book, because its all imagined, some worlds that are kind of existing in imagination and people, they can play and they can believe in\u001b[0m\n",

Isaralgagene civaparvovec requires a one-time infusion without preconditioning. The STAAR study is enrolling patients who are on ERT, are ERT pseudo-naïve (defined as having been off ERT for six or more months), or who are ERT-naïve. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track designation to isaralgagene civaparvovec, which has also received Orphan Medicinal Product designation from the European

Companies granted this designation are given the opportunity for more frequent interactions with the FDA. These clinical programs may also be eligible to apply for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review if relevant criteria are met. The FDA has previously granted ST-920 Orphan Drug Designation.</p><p>\"We are thrilled with the FDA\\'s decision to grant Fast Track Designation for ST-920. Fabry is a debilitating disease with life-long impact,\" said Nathalie Dubois-Stringfellow, Ph.D, Sangamo\\'s Senior Vice President, Chief Development Officer. \"This decision from the FDA underscores the potential for ST-920 to address a serious unmet need and serve as a meaningful therapeutic option for patients with Fabry disease. We are highly encouraged by this promising development and look forward to our expected meeting with the FDA on Phase 3 trial design in the summer.\"</p><p>ST-920 is currently being evaluated in the Phase 1/2 STAAR study, with a total of 20 patients dosed to date. In February 2023, Sangamo announced promising results from the STAAR study via an oral presentation at the 19th Annual WORLD<i>Symposium, </i>showing sustained, elevated expression of alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity in the 13 dosed patients as of the data cutoff, 78% globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) substrate clearance at 6-months and 77% reduction in urine podocyte loss in one of the first kidney biopsies, and a clinically meaningful and statistically significant increase in mean general health scores, as measured by the SF-36 General Health survey. A copy of the presentation is available in the <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.sangamo.com%2Fpresentations&amp;esheet=53403648&amp;newsitemid=20230522005108&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Presentations+section+of+the+Sangamo+website&amp;index=1&amp;md5=b8ed12a9ebf94820f3dec0b898757f74\">Presentations section of the Sangamo website</a>. Sangamo is currently preparing for a potential Phase 3 trial and plans to meet with the FDA on the proposed Phase 3 study design in the summer, with a trial start anticipated by the end of 2023, depending on regulatory interactions.</p><p><strong>About the STAAR Study</strong></p><p>The Phase 1/2 STAAR study is a global open-label, single-dose, dose-ranging, multicenter clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of isaralgagene civaparvovec, or ST-920, a gene therapy product candidate in patients with Fabry disease. Isaralgagene civaparvovec requires a one-time infusion without preconditioning. The STAAR study is enrolling patients who are on ERT, are ERT pseudo-naïve (defined as having been off ERT for six or more months), or who are ERT-naïve. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track designation to isaralgagene civaparvovec, which has also received Orphan Medicinal Product designation from the European Medicines Agency.</p>', text='Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.

Isaralgagene civaparvovec requires a one-time infusion without preconditioning. The STAAR study is enrolling patients who are on ERT, are ERT pseudo-naïve (defined as having been off ERT for six or more months), or who are ERT-naïve. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track designation to isaralgagene civaparvovec, which has also received Orphan Medicinal Product designation from the European Medicines Agency.</p>', text='Sangamo Therapeutics, Inc.

(NASDAQ:<a class=\"ticker\" href=\"https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SGMO#NASDAQ\">SGMO</a>), a genomic medicine company, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track Designation to isaralgagene civaparvovec, or ST-920, a wholly owned gene therapy product candidate for the treatment of Fabry disease.</p><p>Fast Track designation aims to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new therapeutics that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. Companies granted this designation are given the opportunity for more frequent interactions with the FDA. These clinical programs may also be eligible to apply for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review if relevant criteria are met. The FDA has previously granted ST-920 Orphan Drug Designation.</p><p>\"We are thrilled with the FDA\\'s decision to grant Fast Track Designation for ST-920. Fabry is a debilitating disease with life-long impact,\" said Nathalie Dubois-Stringfellow, Ph.D, Sangamo\\'s Senior Vice President, Chief Development Officer. \"This decision from the FDA underscores the potential for ST-920 to address a serious unmet need and serve as a meaningful therapeutic option for patients with Fabry disease. We are highly encouraged by this promising development and look forward to our expected meeting with the FDA on Phase 3 trial design in the summer.\"</p><p>ST-920 is currently being evaluated in the Phase 1/2 STAAR study, with a total of 20 patients dosed to date. In February 2023, Sangamo announced promising results from the STAAR study via an oral presentation at the 19th Annual WORLD<i>Symposium, </i>showing sustained, elevated expression of alpha-galactosidase A (α-Gal A) activity in the 13 dosed patients as of the data cutoff, 78% globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) substrate clearance at 6-months and 77% reduction in urine podocyte loss in one of the first kidney biopsies, and a clinically meaningful and statistically significant increase in mean general health scores, as measured by the SF-36 General Health survey. A copy of the presentation is available in the <a href=\"https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Finvestor.sangamo.com%2Fpresentations&amp;esheet=53403648&amp;newsitemid=20230522005108&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Presentations+section+of+the+Sangamo+website&amp;index=1&amp;md5=b8ed12a9ebf94820f3dec0b898757f74\">Presentations section of the Sangamo website</a>. Sangamo is currently preparing for a potential Phase 3 trial and plans to meet with the FDA on the proposed Phase 3 study design in the summer, with a trial start anticipated by the end of 2023, depending on regulatory interactions.</p><p><strong>About the STAAR Study</strong></p><p>The Phase 1/2 STAAR study is a global open-label, single-dose, dose-ranging, multicenter clinical study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of isaralgagene civaparvovec, or ST-920, a gene therapy product candidate in patients with Fabry disease. Isaralgagene civaparvovec requires a one-time infusion without preconditioning. The STAAR study is enrolling patients who are on ERT, are ERT pseudo-naïve (defined as having been off ERT for six or more months), or who are ERT-naïve. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted Orphan Drug and Fast Track designation to isaralgagene civaparvovec, which has also received Orphan Medicinal Product designation from the European Medicines Agency.</p>', text='Sangamo Therapeutics Receives U.S. FDA Fast Track Designation For Isaralgagene Civaparvovec For The Treatment Of Fabry Disease', text_embedding=[-0.06179793,

Currently, ST-920 is being evaluated in the Phase 1/2 STAAR study, with 20 patients having been dosed to date. Promising results from this study were previously announced in February 2023, showcasing sustained elevated expression of alpha-galactosidase A activity in patients. \n",
